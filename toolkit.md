There are many tools I use to increase my productivity and efficiency. Following are
some highly recommended tools.


### Time-management

----------------

#### [Productivity Challenge Timer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wlxd.pomochallenge&hl=en)

**Brief description**: Allotting chunks of time for deep, focused and
distraction-free work can be extremely helpful. This app helps with that and
more. What I really like about it is that, by design, the app is quite strict:
it is especially helpful if you're running low on self-discipline.

### Effective learning

----------------

#### [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)

**Brief description**: [Spaced
repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) is a learning
technique that is well-known to make learning more effective, and greatly
improve retention. Anki makes implementing spaced repetition a piece of cake. It
works on Linux, Mac OS, Windows, iOS, Android, and on any device with a web
browser. It syncs effortlessly across devices.
