Following is a curated list of books that I have recently read or am still
reading. By curated, I mean books that I enjoyed enough to recommend to a
friend. At any given time, I jump between reading about five books.


### Non-fiction

#### Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman

**Status**: Completed

**Brief insight**: Reading about our cognitive biases and systematic errors of
  judgement, consciously working on noticing them, and taking steps towards
  correcting for them has made me more effective and productive.

----------------

#### Deep Work by Cal Newport

**Status**: Completed

**Brief insight**: Newport defines Deep Work as, "Professional activities
performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive
capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill,
and are hard to replicate." Scheduling more *focused* time for deep work and
eliminating shallow work has greatly improved my productivity.

#### Basic Economics: A Citizen's Guide to the Economy by Thomas Sowell

**Status**: Reading

**Brief insight**: When I was younger and more naive, I remember thinking the
local grocer to be greedy for charging higher prices for everything as compared
to a giant hypermarket. This book has not only helped me dispel that erroneous
notion, but also understand what free markets can and cannot do, how economics
is all about "the study of scarce resources which have alternative uses", and
what purpose do prices, profits and losses serve. This book covers an enormous
number of topics (the audiobook is nearly 24 hours long).
