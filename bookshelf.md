Follwing is a curated list of books that I have read or am still reading.


### Non-fiction

----------------

#### Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman

**Status**: Completed

**Brief insight**: Reading about our cognitive biases and systematic errors of
  judgement, consciously working on noticing them, and taking steps towards
  correcting for them has made me more effective and productive.

----------------

#### Deep Work by Cal Newport

**Status**: Completed

**Brief insight**: Newport defines Deep Work as, "Professional activities
performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive
capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill,
and are hard to replicate." Scheduling more *focused* time for deep work and
eliminating shallow work has greatly improved my productivity.
